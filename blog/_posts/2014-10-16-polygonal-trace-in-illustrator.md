To become better with Illustrator I did this quick study on a portrait of my girlfriend. Pen tool in Illustrator was used to trace triangles over a portrait of my girlfriend. The triangles was thereafter imported as paths in photoshop so that gradients could more easily be applied. End result was pretty good but some things should be done differently, especially the fact that it came out as a rasterized image and not a vector image. <!--more-->

The polygons were made quite small and together with the colors in the gradients the end result had a very subtle polygon effect. If viewed at a distance the effect is almost that of a pastel painting.

Btw, funny story. I printed a copy on meticulously chosen paper stock and framed it in an antique frame. I gave this as a gift to my girlfriend. But apparently I had hyped my gift to much and she was quite disappointed that the gift was not the "expected wedding ring." :/ (It's coming sometime, babe. <3 You know it!)
