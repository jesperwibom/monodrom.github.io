*In early 2016 a man was visiting his parents in the sleepy Swedish village of "Halmstad". He went through all the regular routines, ate to much of his parents well cooked and well meaning food and sleept in his old room in the house where he grew up. Ultimately, the man felt gravely bored and decided to meet up some friends at the local pub. The pub was called 'Ölfiket', loosely translated to Beer-coffee-break-place. What he was about to witness there that night would change his perception of what was real, and what was not!*<!--more-->

The night was largely uneventful, as a small-town night can be. The man and his friends all joked around, everything seemingly being allright, nothing out of the ordinary. There was Rasmus the old rocker, dreaming and telling stories about old fame. Albin, the sleep-deprived local physician and Anders, the tallest of them all. "One day you'll see!" said the almost asleep Albin. "I will travel far away from this stink hole! To a land that's actually cool..." Albin felt asleep mid-sentence. Just as Rasmus the rock-gubbe was about to wake him up by crashing his beer-mug in his face Anders slowly stood up and said "Don't do that." Anders, who was the sensitive of them three did not really need to speak because as he rose to his feet Rasmus had immediately put down his drink and all the people gathered at the pub that night became quiet as the tallest man alive commanded their attention.

"Be nice!" he said to no one in particular. The man visiting his parents bought a beer for himself and the tall one and they drank to health. And afterwards Anders bought tequila and they drank again, for no one in particular. They probably drank more beer and probably some other notorious characters (like the unnamed man's younger brothers "Bill" and "Bäng") was there to drink with them. As with most thirsty nights not all of those attending could be remembered by name.. (G-man was not there however and no one could remember why..)

## Suddenly...

Suddenly, because of a sudden rift in time (known to the Swedish high-aristocracy as a "sommartid") an hour passed in the blink of an eye and the Beer-coffee-break-place closed. They put the sleeping doctor under a table. "He will be comfortable here!" said Anders. The people then moved out into the chilly night air.

While chit-chatting about this and that and what is hip and so and so (also known as the Swedish art form of 'weather-snax' [trans.: Moa, 2014]) a shadowy figure moved slowly up from behind. All of a sudden Anders roared out in pain. He started jumping around, almost dancing in a way, but clearly in pain. The man visiting his parents looked down just to see a long-fanged evil-doing crab crab-walking away. He stood still so as not to anger the crab further but when it was gone he ran to help his friend. But unfortunately it was to late...

Anders was gone, in his place was a possessed crab-man. He walked like a crab, moved like a crab, even talked like a crab and also wanted to eat falafel. Just like a crab! The man visiting his parents realized that this was very serious; no one had seen a man-crab in many years and he felt that he needed to take a picture so that people would believe him. This was a big mistake!

With his electric shining crab-eyes the crab-man looked straight into the man's eyes. The man felt the darkness closing around him as he fell deeper and deeper into madness. The previous tallest-man-alive but now the tallest-crab-alive moved slowly, and then fast, and the slowly again. Every time sideways, never directly back, never straight ahead. It was the crab-dance of death that crabs do to prepare themselves before they do the final killing blow. The man would soon feel the steely touch of man-crab-claws tearing into his flesh.

## Suddenly... (again)

Suddenly, too-cool-for-rock-school-Rasmus came out from the falafel place next door. He held in his hands a so called "extra-stor" with non-complementary "blandad sås". In a split second Anders the crab side-step attacked him and bit his hands clean of. Blood and falafel was everywhere. In all the commotion – Anders eating Rasmus falafel (with extra hands, Rasmus hands!) and Rasmus screaming and bleeding from his previously attached hands – the visiting man ran away. He ran as fast as he could! (He was also not very hungry and wanted neither falafel or McD so it was – in a way – alright. Hopefully there would be cheese and sandwiches in his parents fridge when he got home)(There was!) Suddenly the screams stopped and the man looked back. Anders the crab and Rocky the handless where nowhere to be seen, completely gone, puts väck! Like they both had been swallowed by the earth itself.  

The man barely got away alive, mourning is possessed friend but glad to be alive. Weeks after he could still see those glowing crab-eyes in his nightmares (also in his day-mares and whatnot). And you may wonder "Who was this man you told us about?" Well, my friends, that man was me! Sir Andersson of Plaskedam himself. So next time you visit the old Beer-coffee-break-place heed this waring and look in the shadows. For you might just get a glimps of the tallest crab-man alive, Anders, aka Crabby.
