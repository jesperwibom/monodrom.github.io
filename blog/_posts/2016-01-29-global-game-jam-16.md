So, I attended Global Game Jam '16 in Malm√∂, Sweden. It was so much fun! Me and some other classmates signed up as a team since we have never done a game jam before. But boy will I be back next year!<!--more-->

Together we had 48h to complete a game, from concept to fully playable state. This years theme, which was presented for us just before the jam started, was 'rituals'. Quite an open theme and we brainstormed around a lot of different ideas, both calm interactive experiences and more challenging competitive games. Either exploring the ritualistic actions of people or letting the theme be more of an aesthetic context for which a more traditional game experience could live.

If this sounds *pretentious* or sounds as we thought about it *to much*, you will be pleased to know that the final concept we decided to go with was a very simple side scrolling action game where you played a viking "sacrificing" animals on your way to nirvana! (Yes, nirvana not Valhalla.) The full title was 'Sacrifice All the Animals On Your Journey To Nirvana'.

I think we all thought the jam was a success, even though the game won't win any prices, because we focused on the *process* of creating games, not the finished result. We didn't work 24/7, we didn't implement to fancy features. Instead we kept it simple so that we could test stuff as working in Unity's 2d engine, version control in unity projects using git, concept creation, a little bit scrum, asset integration, project structure and a lot of other stuff. We are interaction designer after all, not game developers. This live environment that pushed us to complete our game also was a great testing ground for our design and project management skills.
