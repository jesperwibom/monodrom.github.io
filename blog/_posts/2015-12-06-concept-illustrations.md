Some recent illustrations I've made for various school projects and concepts. Most are sketched, traced and colored.<!--more-->

## The Dash-card

The dash card was a complementary concept/reimagine of the Amazon Dash button. Made by sketching, tracing and finally coloring with ProMarkers. (Red Bull logo aside, the illustration came out looking a bit like their marketing.)

In this concept the members of Amazon Prime were meant to be sent a member-card equipped with an RFID-tag. Our version of the Dash button would then have a RFID reader so that any button could be used by any member to get goods sent directly on scan to their home address. Current Dash buttons are directly connected to a specific user account which we identified as an obstacle for users adopting this IoT tech.

## Woof playdate service

This is a concept illustration about a tracking dog collar and a complementary "playdate for dogs"-service. The illustration of the 'Woof'-concept demanded some biological shapes (dogs) which I am really bad at drawing freestyle. :( So I made a quick photo composite of fitting google images search results and traced over these instead. I thereafter colored the illustration with awesome ProMarkers!

## PackIt delivery service

This last illustration is for an current ongoing school project focusing on logistics and IoT. It is uncolored as it has not been used for presentation, only to talk about the concept between team members and and explain it to our teachers.
