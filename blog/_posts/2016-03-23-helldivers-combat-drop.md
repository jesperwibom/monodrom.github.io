There are some moments in video games that is *the* moment, the moment you get hooked, the moment you "understand the game". In *Helldivers* this happens in the beginning of each level.<!--more-->

In the game you play as a soldier drop into combat from a space ship. To start a level you take place in your own drop pod and are then launched down to the planets surface where you have to complete objectives and defeat a ton of monsters. Preferably you will have squadmates joining you in combat.

> **"swwoooOOOSH! BOOM!"**

The moment the level has finished loading your pod lands - correction: crashes - on to the planets surface. Your friends' pods come down crashing around you and together you jump out ready to face whatever difficulty the map has to offer. Except you are not. Not ready for the objectives, the enemies, the terrors. If you are lucky you will land undetected and have time to can call down equipment and supplies, but inevitably some enemy scout will spot you and call for reinforcements.

But the first moment, the sound "swwoooOOOSH! BOOM!" made by the drop pod as it crash you down on the planet is amazing. And at least for a couple of moments you can feel like a badass. Later in the game you realize that these drops can be deadly if you happen to be standing where they come down. But in that first drop each level you come down organized, as a team of deadly commandos, sharp, alert, with a vengeance.


Overall, Helldivers sound design is lovely. The guns sound meaty and are very satisfying to fire. When your clip is almost empty you hear a metallic clang when you press the trigger, letting you know that you have to reload soon. If you don't you will soon hear the clank sound indicating an empty clip.

If I would say one thing I do not like it would be the fact that on PS4 these auxiliary sounds are played through the DualShock4 controller speaker. The intention seem to be to give the player a feeling of holding a gun and not a controller. However the small and very thin sound coming from the controller speaker is too different in terms of quality from the lovely audio experience that is coming from the tv. For me this is to apparent and it somewhat my immersion in the game.
