			<p class="quote">The year is 1619 and I have just escaped execution at the hands of my own king. I might have died in peace but for the burning need to clear my name. Destiny has driven my here, to the edge of human exploration. Some call this place the new world. The Romans called it Mars.</p><!--more-->

      <p><em>Jamestown</em> is set in a sort of steam-punkish alternate history where the British and Spanish empires both colonized the red planet Mars. An evil conquistador has found the 'heart of Mars', an ancient artifact that could grant him tremendous power over the red planet. You must travel to the dark zone of Mars, find the conquistador and stop him. The road there is filled of hazards and betentacled enemies but also unexpected allies.

      <h2>how it works</h2>
			<p>Jamestown is a gorgeous, spectacular shoot 'em up game. In a shoot 'em up game, also called a shmup or "bullet hell" games, the player is tasked with traversing levels, often in some kind of space-craft, fighting scores of enemies and dodging their incoming fire. Some times the whole screen will be filled with projectiles and the player must overcome these complex navigational puzzle in order to be victorious. So much with shoot 'em up games are about limitations. Limited movement, only shoot in one direction and a screen that is always moving forward forcing the action upon the player, ready or not.</p>
			<p>These mechanics is also seen in Jamestown. It is a labour of love that builds on top of decades of fine tuning the genre and the balance of Jamestown's difficulty levels and the feel of its controls are as good as they can get. In addition to the usual mechanics you can select between different ships with different strength and weaknesses. Your ship carries two weapons, one primary and one secondary. The primary weapon is often rapid firing so it can be used for lighter and faster enemies. The second weapon is often times more powerful but has slow re-charge, slow your ship or have limited range.</p>
			<p>A fundamental mechanic in Jamestown is the "vaunt" meter. When a player kills an enemy a gold token is released. This can be picked up and fills up the vaunt meter slightly. When full a player can trigger a "Vaunt" which grants him a shield for a couple of seconds. After that the vaunt meter goes down slowly but for each second it is running you get bonus points. By collecting more gold while it is active you can get more bonus points but stand the chance of not having a shield when you suddenly need it.</p>

      <h2>what you do</h2>
      <p>These mechanics, including also the scaling difficulty while playing cooperatively with friends, facilitates the feeling of being constantly challenged. It is <em>so</em> very accessible for total beginners but scales very nicely into the harder difficulties when the earlier stages have become mastered and are not enough anymore. The campaign only lets you play the later stages if you complete the earlier levels on the harder difficulties.</p>
      <p>Jamestown is a game where challenge meet fellowship, where four player co-op open up for completely new strategies and ways to tackle the unrelentless enemies. The challenges (unlocked with the gold you earn from each stage) demand completely different strategies if your party includes two, three or four players and they are marked as fully completed only when you've played <em>all</em> variations (i.e 1p, 2p, 3p <em>and</em> 4 players).</p>
      <p>Finally you can run the "gauntlet", in which you must do a flawless run of the complete game. That means no extra lives and no continues. One hit == "Game over, man! Game over!". I can't stress enough how hard and nerv-wrecking this is.</p>

      <h2>why it is awesome</h2>
      <p>Jamestown is good, not only because of it's perfectly balanced game play, but it exudes quality through and through. The pixel art is absolutely stunning, the animations are great, the <em>interface</em> and menus are very well done and the control setup and other configurations are all designed to let you play the game as fast as possible. You just pick your controller of choice, whether it is a mouse or a gamepad, hold a button, quickly calibrate the three buttons needed and that's it!</p>
      <p>There are also several different ships to unlock which means that the gameplay is constantly evolving. As you try new ships and combinations of ships you find new strategies. This really allow the game to have even more longevity.</p>
      <p>It is clearly a labour of love, every pixel carefully placed, gameplay tweeked as close to perfectly balanced as you can come, music and stages that blend so equisite together.</p>
