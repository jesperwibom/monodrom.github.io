While reading some of my classmates posts about the game Monopoly, more specifically their experience of cheating related to this game, I felt a small itch. I just could not shake the feeling that cheating in a game where most interactions are governed by chance and where the game give advantages toward players that are already ahead is not actually cheating. Is acting against an unfair set of rules actually cheating?<!--more-->

So of course this question will be to large to answer in a small blog post like this. It is related to the profoundly more important topic of civil disobedience and the philosophical arguments for and against this practice. Civil disobedience is to act against certain laws in order to change policy. It is often non-violent but this is not implicit in its definition.

If Monopoly would be a societal system of governance – a set of implicit attitudes and explicit laws that control our actions and how we interact within our community/society – it could easily be argued that such a system would be quite unfair. \**wink-wink*

## Cheating
Back to the cheating. Knutsson (2016) talks about one of the recent editions of Monopoly where paper money has been replaced with plastic cards and a card reader. He explains that he could then more easily get away with cheating because the transaction of funds was easier to hide. He could just "[...]have the display only fronted at me, which means that I don’t necessary need to show my opponents how much money I transferring."

So the card reader made it easier to cheat. This was not, however, Knutsson's reason for cheating.He did not cheat because he could but rather, he explains, that the pacing of the game did not allow for a clear winner in the time he had to play. Even if there was one player in the lead the progress experienced by the game group as a whole was very low. Knutsson's reason to cheat was because of pacing issues created by the game mechanics.

## Flawed rules or flawed economic system
Monopoly's rules are [flawed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeLPNVmzerg). And they have been for as long as the game has existed. Monopoly was actually first known as "The Landlord's game" and was created by Elizabeth Magie. Patented in 1903 and released in 1906 it is very similar to the game we know today. But Magie would not be credited as the creator of Monopoly. Instead a man named Charles Darrow who happened to play the game at a friends house took full credit and sold the game to Parker Brothers. (Ketcham, 2012)

The game Magie envisioned was one shaped by her political and ethical views. She created two sets of rules, one set of monopoly rules where accumulation of wealth was rewarded, and one set of anti-monopoly rules where wealth creation rewarded every player. Mary Pilon from The Guardian writes:

*"From its inception, the Landlord’s Game aimed to seize on the natural human instinct to compete. And, somewhat surprisingly, Lizzie created two sets of rules: an anti-monopolist set in which all were rewarded when wealth was created, and a monopolist set in which the goal was to create monopolies and crush opponents. Her vision was an embrace of dualism and contained a contradiction within itself, a tension trying to be resolved between opposing philosophies."* (Pilon, 2015)

The Landlord's Game became quite popular, and players immediately started to modify the rules. From its inception house rules have been part of the "Monopoly experience". The different re-releases and themed versions testify to this, going full circle with the release of the ["House Rules Edition"](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2596909/Hasbro-picks-5-house-rules-new-Monopoly-set.html)

## The only rules
From Magie's two different sets of rules we now only play Monopoly to crush our opponents by accumulating wealth. We only play the "monopoly"-rules. The game that started out as [a tool for discussing inequalities and the *dangers* of strong monopolization](http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2986/was-monopoly-originally-meant-to-teach-people-about-the-evils-of-capitalism) now days is indoctrinating kids (from 8 years and up) into a falsely grounded belief that this is how our economy should work and the only possible way it can work.

So when Knutsson, you, me or kids anywhere cheat at Monopoly they may just be saying: "Hey, if this is how our economic and social system works it really sucks and I won't play by these rules." Maybe they express a intuitive civil disobedience facing these apparent flaws in the rules. Or maybe they're just brats that can't play nice. [(which will coincidentally make them super good at real world capitalism!)](http://www.alternet.org/story/146819/america's_ten_most_corrupt_capitalists)
