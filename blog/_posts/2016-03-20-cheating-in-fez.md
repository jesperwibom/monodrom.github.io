A recent discussion in class about cheating in video games have made me quite confused about what actually count as cheating. Is for example using the warp zones in Super Mario cheating? Is the grenade launcher attachment in CoD: Modern Warfare all to much cheese, verging on game breaking?<!--more--> Is following a strategy guide an exploit in the same manner? Is there a difference in guide and walkthrough in the context of cheating?

Have you played [Fez](https://www.fezgame.com/)? I have! It's an absolute masterpiece as far as I am concerned. It is so good that I doubt that I will ever become a game designer. It is so amazingly beautiful to the point that the mere existence of it discourage me from trying to create a game of my own. (I do exaggerate, but honestly, not as much as I would like to admit.) If you have played Fez did you finish it? Did you complete it 100%\*? Every level, every room, found every shard? I did! Did I cheat? Well...

\*the maximum completion percentage is actually 209,3%

Cheating, in my mind, is when a player perform actions that are in some way derived from a possible *gain outside of the game's context*. A weird definition perhaps, let me try to explain in another way. When Skyrim was first released by Bethesda in 2011 a player could exploit a bug in the leveling system that awarded un-proportional amounts of experience points for crafting of a knife. This allowed players to too quickly level up their skill in smithing. The players using this to their advantage was motivated by getting an advantage in the game by exploiting some aspect of it that was not intended. This aspect was therefore outside of the *designers intended game context*.
(Omg, a lot of unexplained terms here! I'm sorry for not properly explaining all these concepts but I will perhaps return to this subject another time.)

To complete the game Fez I used a walkthrough. I am not a cryptographer, and I only sort of enjoy a brutally hard puzzle. When Fez was first released dedicated players everywhere were trying to find out the last secrets to complete the game with the response from the developers being ["Good luck with that. It's practically impossible."](http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/04/why-it-took-almost-a-week-for-the-world-to-completely-finish-fez/)

I needed a lot of help along the way. With the secret questions, how to use the first person view, to find some of the cube shards and anti cubes, and of course with finding the cube hearts. The thing is, as far as I know, no one has been able to fully solve the final puzzle of the monolith without getting help from the developers. It is even possible that a logical solution to the monolith is not available, that the last secret comes as is, without clues for frustrated players.

When solving puzzles or cracking codes you often make a guess as where to start. You can then use brute force to go through all possible combinations starting from your first guess. So if a game is demanding its players to perform this extensive menial task there really is no way to properly play the game. To rephrase: if no solution is to be had in a puzzle game, is the puzzle actually a game? Possibly it is instead "only" a cryptographic problem and as such 'cheating' becomes a trivial term.

A puzzle without solution could be said to be missing a *designers intended game context*. If no game context is to be found it is not possible to cheat at all. Ergo, I **did not** cheat!

*(This is of course all speculation and my argument is based on an undefined definition of 'game'. If this term would be inclusive toward some common tasks, even those that do not have a designed gaming context, my justification for using a walkthrough when playing Fez falls.)*
