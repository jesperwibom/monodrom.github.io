Like Light is a concept where a burning candle 'likes' a page on Facebook. As long as the candle burns the 'like' is active. But if you blow out the flame or if the candle burns down, the 'like' disappears.

## +1 one-up like

This project was created as a comment on digital religion and social media activism. The Facebook 'like' is ubiquitous. The type of activity we may call 'like', '+1' or 'up-vote' has become a fundamental part of how we interact on the internet/in social media. But we wanted to explore if it is actually meaningful?

Trying to explore the meaning and value of these 'one-ups', we drew inspiration from the symbolic act of lighting a candle. We designed an interaction which make room for *reflection* where there is usually only *expression*.

By making the user light a candle the act of 'liking' a page on Facebook become an active act instead of something you do in passing. When the candle burns out the 'like' disappears. It becomes something temporary and only by nurturing the flame you keep showing your commitment to 'liking' the page.

Where the Facebook LikeLight is a commentary about activism on social media, the Twitter LikeLight is a much more complete product. Instead of using ‘likes’ the user can with this device set a hashtag “on fire”. As long as the candle is burning a tweet will exist. It displays the tag and a message declaring that it is made by a LikeLight. Being more of an expression it is therefore better suited for social media applications.
