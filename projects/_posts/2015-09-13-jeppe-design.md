Jeppe.design is the page you currently are viewing. It is developed from scratch for use with [Jekyll][jekyll], a static site generator and it is the home of my project, both professional, educational and personal.

I knew from the start that I wanted a combined platform for both a blog and a project presentation section. I wanted the blog so that I could be more free in my writing and publish more personal articles and smaller projects, projects which not necessarily would make it to the project gallery section.

The technical demands of this type of site is nothing special or even demanding so a content management system, a CMS like Wordpress, seemed at the time redundant and risked increasing the complexity unnecessarily. Like so many others before me, I found out about and started using Jekyll. Jekyll is a static site generator and it helped me to create a fully static site, without any database or server running tasks.


## Design

Since this site represents my professional self, albeit with a personal touch, fairly much work has gone into the presentation, aesthetics, navigation and branding aspects of the design. Keep in mind that I am not an expert on branding or marketing, I still do believe that these are also very important aspects of design, especially when it comes to present yourself. Anyway, I gave it my best shoot and you, the viewer, have to judge by yourself if the endeavour was successful.

To help the design process I made a list of word, keywords that I felt communicated who I am and how I work. These words were changed a bit under development, however the final words were **'Strong'**, **'Colorful'**, **'Deliberate'** and **'Direct'**. This list of words, this effort of *personal brand representation* was extremely helpful when taking design decisions under the whole development phase. Decisions, small as large, benefited from this and I do recommend doing this when designing a personal portfolio.
