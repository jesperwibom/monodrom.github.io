Our goal with this project was to create a game for adults. Our game had the player sitting down trying to defuse a bomb with the help of an extremely obtuse "Bomb defusal guide".<!--more--> Our game borrows liberally from the type of game play games like *Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes* offers. In our version the interaction is physical and our focus while developing was always more on experimenting with micro-controllers and prototype boards in general. This was the first time we used prototyping tools like the Arduino and the end result was in the light of this fairly successful.

## Game

In this game the player sits with a "bomb" in front of them. When it is activated the player begins to try and disarm it. This is achieved by connecting the correct colored wire to one of four inputs. If the user believe they have the correct combination of wires connected they then press the big red button. They must complete three such stages before the timer runs out to completely disarm the bomb and win the game.

To create as much stress and tension as possible, we played a beep each four seconds. As the game progressed we decreased the interval to indicate that time is running out. When testing the game play we also did not mention this "feature" to the testers. Such a small feedback and yet made the testers quite unable to focus properly on reading the manual.

## Prototype

Notice that the pins that goes directly to ground, line 21-23-25-27 and 34-36-40-42, are connected up in the final product with the in-out wires. The lines with pull-down resistors are the inputs and the four lines to the left are outputs.
When reading what wire is in which input we quickly cycle through each output wire, letting them be HIGH for a couple of milli seconds each. At this time we also cycle through the inputs to see if any of those pins are receiving current. We do this for each output wire, i.e four times total, to read which wires are connected to which pins.

## Defuse the bomb!

The game has multiple solutions and every stage a solution is randomly selected. To make it easy for us to create specific solutions we stored them in a 2d array. On each new stage a random integer is generated (between zero and the length of the solutions array) and this is used to select the solution array index.

The solutions where all in the "Bomb defusal guide". But this guide was designed to be as hard as possible to read and understand. Since the design of the prototype also demanded two hands to operate the testers constantly lost the place where they were in the text. The game was easier(read *possible*) to complete when two players were cooperating.
